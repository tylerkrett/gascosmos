N2O or Nitrous Oxide is a tasteless, colourless, non inflammable, bacteriostatic (stops growth of bacteria) gas with a slightly sweet odour. N2O is used worldwide as a food propellant especially in the dairy industry.\n\nSince N2O, if inhaled concentrated and in larger quantities has a weak anaesthetic effect, it has been used by doctors and dentists since the late 18th century. LISS N2O Chargers contain a relatively small quantity of only 8 gram N2O to whip up 0,5 l / 1 pint of cream, which makes it absolutely impossible to feel any side effects, if used properly. However, like all things N2O can also be misused!\n\nGastro Grey is available in the UK, Ireland, Portugal & Spain.</p>\n\n          <p>\n          All our stock comes with COI, Certificate of Origin with all labelling in strict accordance with EU 169/2011 EK regulations meeting Worldwide Food Standard requirements regulations.\n          </p>\n          <img width=\"100%\" src={pic6}  />\n         \n      \n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </section>\n  </Layout>\n);\n\nexport default IndexPage;\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
