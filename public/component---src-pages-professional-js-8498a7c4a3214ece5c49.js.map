This then flavours the overall substance.\n\nOnce the pressure in the whipping device has been released, the N20 then forms bubbles and takes on the flavours of the ingredient, transferring the aroma into the liquid.</p>\n<h4 className=\"major\">Espuma</h4>\n\n<p>The Spanish word for foam, Espuma involves creating airily light foams to go on top of a range of different beverages.  To achieve this texture, people in all corners of the globe used whippers and as a result, they are now a common sight in many modern-day kitchens.\n\nIt’s easy to prepare espumas from purees, cream and extracts, from juices, coulis, as well as soups or sauces, and they can be added to a diverse range of dishes and drinks. Espumas are not only a great way to enhance the flavours of food, but they are also a great way of optimising the aesthetic appeal of food.</p>\n<h4 className=\"major\">Filling And Decorating</h4>\n\n<p>\nWhen it comes to adding a new and exciting dimension to your favourite dishes, it’s all about getting your filling and decorating right, especially when it comes to enhancing its presentation.\n\nThere are a whole host of high performance tools that can be used to unleash your imagination in the kitchen, allowing you to experiment with different flavours, textures and finishes.\n</p>\n\n<h4 className=\"major\">Beverage Industry</h4>\n<p>A vast range of our Co2 products is used within the beverage industry and can be used to create drinks and perform rapid infusion.</p>\n<h4 className=\"major\">Beer And Soda</h4>\n<p>We offer a range of different cartridges that can be used for pressurising and injecting Co2 into standard 2-inch neck plastic homebrew beer barrels.\n\nFilled with 8 grams of natural carbon dioxide, all of our cartridges can be used for successfully carbonating and pressuring lots of different drink types.\n\nPlease note: you should always check that your barrel has the right adapter, as it’s vital that you keep your barrel pressurised. This is because as it empties, it will ensure that air is kept out in order to preserve your beer.\n<br /><br />\nSoda:\n\nOur Co2 soda charger bulbs can also be used with a wide range of soda makers, allowing you to enjoy refreshing, sparkling soda water whenever you please. Ideal for adding a healthy dose of fizz to your favourite drinks, a soda maker will also allow you to add an extra fizzy kick to long drinks and cocktails.\n\nCarbon dioxide is a pure and natural product that has been created deep within the earth by volcanic processes, therefore it is now used as an organic ingredient that naturally keeps your drinks fresher for longer.\n<br /><br />\nBeer:\n\n\nWe also provide a great choice of cylinders that contain 16 grams of natural carbon dioxide.
