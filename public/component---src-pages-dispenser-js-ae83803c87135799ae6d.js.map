The process works when the N20 gas flows out of the cream charger into the liquid, which then forces the liquid to bind together with the N20 due to the high pressure that it is under. This then flavours the overall substance. Once the pressure in the whipping device has been released, the N20 then forms bubbles and takes on the flavours of the ingredient, transferring the aroma into the liquid.\n              </p>\n  \n            </article>\n            <article>\n              <a href=\"/#\" className=\"image\">\n                <img src={pic8} alt=\"\" />\n              </a>\n              <h3 className=\"major\">Espuma</h3>\n              <p>\n              The Spanish word for foam, Espuma involves creating airily light foams to go on top of a range of different beverages.
