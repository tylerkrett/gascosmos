          </p>

          <h4 className="major">Classic Cream Application</h4>
<p>Whippers are used in all areas of the catering industry when it comes to whipping cream and preparing sauces, cocktails, foams, espumas, as well as many other culinary delicacies.

And despite many advances in technology, whippers remain one of the best ways of preparing cream, and other liquid-based ingredients</p>

<h4 className="major">Aromatising And Infusion</h4>

<p>Infusing techniques are adopted my chefs in all corners of the world when it comes infusing liquids with different aromas.

The process works when the N20 gas flows out of the cream charger into the liquid, which then forces the liquid to bind together with the N20 due to the high pressure that it is under. This then flavours the overall substance.

Once the pressure in the whipping device has been released, the N20 then forms bubbles and takes on the flavours of the ingredient, transferring the aroma into the liquid.</p>
<h4 className="major">Espuma</h4>

<p>The Spanish word for foam, Espuma involves creating airily light foams to go on top of a range of different beverages.  To achieve this texture, people in all corners of the globe used whippers and as a result, they are now a common sight in many modern-day kitchens.

It’s easy to prepare espumas from purees, cream and extracts, from juices, coulis, as well as soups or sauces, and they can be added to a diverse range of dishes and drinks. Espumas are not only a great way to enhance the flavours of food, but they are also a great way of optimising the aesthetic appeal of food.</p>
<h4 className="major">Filling And Decorating</h4>

<p>
When it comes to adding a new and exciting dimension to your favourite dishes, it’s all about getting your filling and decorating right, especially when it comes to enhancing its presentation.

There are a whole host of high performance tools that can be used to unleash your imagination in the kitchen, allowing you to experiment with different flavours, textures and finishes.

<h4 className="major">Beer And Soda</h4>
<p>We offer a range of different cartridges that can be used for pressurising and injecting Co2 into standard 2-inch neck plastic homebrew beer barrels.

Filled with 8 grams of natural carbon dioxide, all of our cartridges can be used for successfully carbonating and pressuring lots of different drink types.

Please note: you should always check that your barrel has the right adapter, as it’s vital that you keep your barrel pressurised. This is because as it empties, it will ensure that air is kept out in order to preserve your beer.
<br /><br />
Soda:

Our Co2 soda charger bulbs can also be used with a wide range of soda makers, allowing you to enjoy refreshing, sparkling soda water whenever you please. Ideal for adding a healthy dose of fizz to your favourite drinks, a soda maker will also allow you to add an extra fizzy kick to long drinks and cocktails.

Carbon dioxide is a pure and natural product that has been created deep within the earth by volcanic processes, therefore it is now used as an organic ingredient that naturally keeps your drinks fresher for longer.
<br /><br />

How to make Nitro Beer:

Nitro beer can be made in one of our stainless-steel cream whippers:

Fill with your favourite stout or ale. - 
Tightly screw on head. - 
Charge with one Nitro Charger. - 
Shake vigorously to dissolve the Nitrogen in the beer. - 
Dispense into cup or glass. The fast jet of dispensing ‘whips’ the nitrogen into the beer.
Nitro Coffee
<br /><br />
Restricting the amount of oxygen in the coffee, Nitrogen works by slowing down the rate of oxidation in the coffee. It is this process which makes coffee taste sour and bitter.

With this in mind, because Nitro coffee retains its fresh flavour for longer, it can be prepared in advance.
<br /><br />
