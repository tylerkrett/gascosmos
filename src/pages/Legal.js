If you think that there is a mistake in these, please contact us to discuss.</li><li><strong>Are you a business customer or a consumer?</strong>&nbsp;In some areas you will have different rights under these terms depending on whether you are a business or consumer.

Your right as a consumer to change your mind does not apply in respect of:<ul><li>products sealed for health protection or hygiene purposes, once these have been unsealed after you receive them; and</li><li>any products which become mixed inseparably with other items after their delivery.</li></ul></li><li><strong>BUSINESSES ONLY Ending the contract where we are not at fault</strong>. Other than in accordance with clause 1, you may not terminate a contract if you have received the products. If you want to terminate a contract before you have received the products, contact us to let us know.

We will pay the costs of return:<ul><li>if the products are faulty or misdescribed; or</li><li>if you are ending the contract because we have told you of an upcoming change to the product or these terms, an error in pricing or description, a delay in delivery due to events outside our control or because you have a legal right to do so as a result of something we have done wrong.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ol>



<p>In all other circumstances (including where you are a consumer exercising your right to change your mind) you must pay the costs of return.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li><strong>How we will refund you</strong>. If you are entitled to a refund under these terms we will refund you the price you paid for the products including delivery costs, by the method you used for payment. However, we may make deductions from the price, as described below.</li><li><strong>CONSUMERS ONLY When we may make deduction from refunds if you are exercising your right to change your mind</strong>. If you are exercising your right to change your mind:<ul><li>We may reduce your refund of the price (excluding delivery costs) to reflect any reduction in the value of the goods, if this has been caused by your handling them in a way which would not be permitted in a shop. If we refund you the price paid before we are able to inspect the goods and later discover you have handled them in an unacceptable way, you must pay us an appropriate amount.</li><li>The maximum refund for delivery costs will be the costs of delivery by the least expensive delivery method we offer. For example, if we offer delivery of a product within 3-5 days at one cost but you choose to have the product delivered within 24 hours at a higher cost, then we will only refund what you would have paid for the cheaper delivery option.</li><li>Where the product is a service, we may deduct from any refund an amount for the supply of the service for the period for which it was supplied, ending with the time when you told us you had changed your mind. The amount will be in proportion to what has been supplied, in comparison with the full coverage of the contract.</li></ul></li><li><strong>CONSUMERS ONLY When your refund will be made</strong>. We will make any refunds due to you as soon as possible. If you are a consumer exercising your right to change your mind then:<ul><li>your refund will be made within 14 days from the day on which we receive the product back from you or, if earlier, the day on which you provide us with evidence that you have sent the product back to us. For information about how to return a product to us, see clause 2.</li><li>in all other cases, your refund will be made within 14 days of your telling us you have changed your mind</li></ul></li></ul>



<ol><li>Our rights to end the contract<ul><li><strong>We may end the contract if you break it</strong>. We may end the contract for a product at any time by writing to you if:<ul><li>you do not make any payment to us when it is due and you still do not make payment within seven days of us reminding you that payment is due;</li><li>you do not, within a reasonable time of us asking for it, provide us with information that is necessary for us to provide the products;</li><li>you do not, within a reasonable time, allow us to deliver the products to you or collect them from us; or</li><li>we suspect you of using the products for improper purposes contrary to clause 5.</li></ul></li><li><strong>You must compensate us if you break the contract</strong>. If we end the contract in the situations set out in clause 1 we will refund any money you have paid in advance for products we have not provided but we may deduct or charge you reasonable compensation for the net costs we will incur as a result of your breaking the contract.</li></ul></li><li>If there is a problem with the product</li></ol>

<ol><li>BUSINESSES ONLY Your rights in respect of defective products<ul><li>We warrant that on delivery any products which are goods shall:<ul><li>conform in all material respects with their description and any relevant specification;</li><li>be free from material defects in design, material and workmanship; and</li><li>be of satisfactory quality (within the meaning of the Sale of Goods Act 1979).</li></ul></li><li>Subject to clause 3, if:<ul><li>you give us notice in writing within a reasonable time of discovery that a product does not comply with the warranty set out in clause 1;</li><li>we are given a reasonable opportunity of examining such product; and</li><li>you return such product to us at our cost,</li></ul></li></ul></li></ol>

It is always possible that, despite our best efforts, some of the products we sell may be incorrectly priced. We will normally check prices before accepting your order so that, where the product’s correct price at your order date is less than our stated price at your order date, we will charge the lower amount. If the product’s correct price at your order date is higher than the price stated to you, we will contact you for your instructions before we accept your order. If we accept and process your order where a pricing error is obvious and unmistakeable and could reasonably have been recognised by you as a mispricing, we may end the contract, refund you any sums you have paid and require the return of any goods provided to you.</li><li><strong>When you must pay and how you must pay</strong>.

<div>
<p>Working with some of the industry&rsquo;s leading manufacturers, we have sold more than 50,000 cream whippers over the past 5 years.</p>
<p>All of the cream whippers and cream chargers we supply have been manufactured to the highest possible standard in order to optimise performance, reliability, and functionality in a wide range of commercial kitchen environments.</p>
<p>Offering outstanding performance when it comes to whipping up sauces, mousses, whipped cream, and more, all of our products not only enhance productivity in the kitchen, but they also offer great value for money.</p>
<p>We sell two types of cream whippers, including Aluminium whippers with plastic heads that are designed for use at home, and professional stainless-steel whippers, which can be used in a whole host of professional catering environments. Aluminium whippers are not suitable for heavy commercial use and must not be put into dishwashers.</p>
<p>In any kitchen environment, it&rsquo;s vital that safety remains a top priority, especially when it comes to preventing accidents. After all, the kitchen is full of potentially harmful tools, utensils, and appliances that, if not used correctly, could cause accidents.</p>
<p>Nobody likes to think that the worst could happen, however safety should always be at the forefront of your mind when you&rsquo;re choosing kitchen appliances from trusted and professional suppliers.</p>
<p>After all, manufacturers that take short cuts with safety features and manufacturing processes, instantly put their customers at risk, and this can result in tragedy.</p>
<p>For example, it was recently reported in the media that a lady tragically died after buying a cheap Chinese-made whipper online. Rebecca Burger, a lifestyle blogger, who was only 33 when she suffered a cardiac arrest after the whipped cream dispense has exploded and stuck to her chest has been injecting gas into the metal canister when it exploded.</p>
<p>This once again highlights the importance of going to a reputable supplier for all of your kitchen appliances, including whipped cream dispensers.</p>
